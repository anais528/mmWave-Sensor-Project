# mmWave-Sensor-Project

The project demonstrates a common machine learning workflow for analyzing time-series or 3D position data, likely sourced from a mmWave radar sensor or similar motion-capture technology.

## Goal
To train and evaluate a Lightweight CNN model (cnn\_model\_simple) that predicts a target state or trajectory based on raw sensor input.

## Input Data
Test Frames (S10\_frames.npy): Multi-dimensional sensor readings (implied to be 3D coordinates, X, Y, Z) for a specific subject (S10).

## Output Data 
Ground Truth (S10\_ground\_truth.npy): The desired or actual outcome/trajectory the model should learn. CNN Predictions (predictions.npy): The output generated by the trained CNN.

## Core Functionality 
The script loads the raw sensor data, the expected output, and the model's predictions. It then normalizes this data for consistent comparison.

## Visualization
The primary function is to generate a three-panel 3D scatter plot comparing the normalized Input Frames, the Ground Truth, and the CNN Predictions. This allows for an immediate visual assessment of the CNN's accuracy in estimating the underlying motion or state.
